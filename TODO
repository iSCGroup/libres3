Important
=====
    * proxy_host support
    * test with dragondisk
    * support/test retries, SX node down, etc.
    * support SSL between LibreS3 and SX

Code cleanup
============
    * drop File backend, add a Mem backend instead - better for testing as some
    code was there only to make file backend atomic
    * drop async json parsing: we get the entire body at once now, so we can simplify parsing
    * should we keep existing build system or use opam?
    * check test coverage with OCaml bisect
    * check coding style with Mascot
    * move URL related code to a separate module
    * see if we can integrate ocamlnet's pipeline with lwt better and drop the extra thread
    * review all code, document failure conditions, add more error checking code

Tests
======
    * should have tests for SX <-> libres3 retries
    * need to inject failures: a mock SX server to be used for testing that can
    simulate the failures (can be a simple pass-through proxy to the real SX
    server, and simulate failures according to a script)
    * should have tests for large files
    * automated package testing

Performance
===========
    * start uploading partial files sooner

Known issues
============
    * configure: should check for presence of Zlib headers (needed by cryptokit)
    * check: does ocamlnet need -enable-crypto to process http deflate?
    * on SIGUSR1 it fails if libres3-gc.log doesn't exist: should get created
    automatically, or use syslog for it
    * CentOS has a default firewall that blocks everything but ssh, have to add
 firewall rules or flush firewall to allow libres3 to be reachable from other
 hosts
    * permissions on libres3.conf should be 600 in rpm
    * version number in rpm name
    * rpm should be signed?
    * make install fails with 'Text file busy' if libres3_ocsigen is already running

User friendliness
=================

    * on bad/unreachable sx_host we should have better error messages
    * netTest.native: better error messages when SX / libres3 is not reachable
    * more friendly message when SSL certificate is configured but missing
    * see if we can detect SSL port mismatches (i.e. https traffic on non-https
                                                * port and viceversa)
    * create sample config for https too
